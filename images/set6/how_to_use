All Metal-texture-creation-sets are CC0 and with some example tertures in every set.

they use self-made synthetic background-textures

The metal-texture-creation-set uses layers and layer-groups

If you have problems opening the xcf-files, you need the newest GIMP version.



you can change the background-texture by using the SELECT BY COLOR-tool and with a mask

first select the layer where you want (it is called something with -00-bg, bg for background)

now choose the SELECT BY COLOR-tool and select the area, you should set the threshold high to be sure to select all.

in the next step you have to go to layer / mask / add layer mask / and choose selection.

now you can copy your texture and copy it in the other one.



the next step is about moving parts

when you want to move parts, you can select a layer or a layer-group.

then you can move parts with the mouse.

you can move parts vertically or horicontally with the arrow-keys.

if your part doesn't move but your layer-selection-mark in the layer-tab, you have to click beside your image.



you also can change the drawing mode of each layer, for example changing opacity or the mode from normal to additive.

and you can use effects like curves (colors/ curves) or other effects


When you want to copy a whole layergroup, you can copy this layergroup.

but when you want to copy parts of a layergroup 
(for example if you want to seperate one of the blueish boxes in set4, you need an addon.

you can find it here.

And whenyou want to copy a layergroup to another image, you need this addon.

Another useful addon is layer-effects

http://registry.gimp.org/node/186
(you should use the .py version and not .scm, because this is a better version, is has more

i used this to setup the 3D-structure with highlight and shadow to my textures.

some other useful tricks are:

under Select: Grow, thrink and border
and under Filter: Blur/Gaussian blur

Also a good plugin is the normalmap-plugin for gimp
